So I'm taking a programming paradigms course this semester and the homework will be published every Friday on a webpage. It's kinda boring to check this webpage manually every Friday to grab the homework. Meanwhile, I noticed that the webpage is quite simple and easy to be scraped using python. So...why not? Spend a few hours to write a small piece of code to grab the homework automatically sounds great.

## All these efforts just to grab your homework? Why?

- It's fun!
- It's cool and that's what we CS student do ðŸ˜‰
- It's a great way to apply what I've learned to solve real world problem.
- It's a typical use case for web scraping and the code can be easily adapted to other scenarios. Have you ever applied for something (for example: a Visa for traveling in another country), and eagerly waited for the result to be published online? Have you ever manually refreshed the webpage again and again just in hope that the result would pop up? Well, let Python do all the work for you so that you can ~~Netflix and Chill~~ spend your time on something more interesting.
