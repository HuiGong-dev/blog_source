The past two months were the so-called "Klausurphase '' in Germany and I barely updated anything here in those two months. Now it's time to restart in this new semester.

Here is my plan:

- Learn how to create RESTful API from scratch
- Learn OAuth 2.0 (perhaps also JWT)
- Learn REACT basic
- Dive into React and build (at least one) full-stack React App

Other than that I also want to learn more about web3 concepts. I‚Äôll update my progress here. Hopefully I will finish building a few more fun projects at the end of this semester.

- What I‚Äôve learned
- What was the challenge
- How I tackled it

Cheers üçª
