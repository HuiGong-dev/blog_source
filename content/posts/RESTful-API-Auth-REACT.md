The past two months were the so-called "Klausurphase '' in Germany and I barely updated anything here in those two months. Now it's time to restart in this new semester.

Here is my plan:

- Learn how to create RESTful API from scratch
- Learn OAuth 2.0 (perhaps also JWT)
- Learn React basics
- Dive into React and build (at least one)  MERN Stack App

Other than that I also want to learn more about web3 concepts. I‚Äôll update my progress here. Hopefully I will finish building a few more fun projects at the end of this semester.

- What I‚Äôve learned
- What was the challenge
- How I tackled it (if done)

Cheers üçª

- What I've learned

Building API using Node.js, express, MongoDB. Finished GET/POST/DELETE methods.

- What was the challenge

Now the API is running on localhost but I need to run it on a server so the next step is to install MongoDB on my server. Other than that everything is fine.
