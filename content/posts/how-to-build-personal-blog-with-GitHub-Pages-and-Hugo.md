You want to build a personal blog but don't want to spend too much time building everything from scratch? Me too! After some research I get to know there're several static site generator out there and the most used generators are: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). All of them can work perfectly with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I chose Hugo as my site generator and it worked perfectly.

## What is Hugo

Hugo is a static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## Why Hugo

It's blazing fast! Hugo's official website states it is "the worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites" and after using it I've nothing to complain about the speed.

Besides, building a blog with Hugo is simple and easy. Here is how:

## Step by step

### Set up GitHub Pages

Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/), login and create a new public repository named `username.github.io`. Be sure the `username` is exactly the same as your GitHub username. For example: my username is `HuiGong-dev` so my repository should be named as `HuiGong-dev.github.io`. Check the official guide [here]((https://pages.github.com/)) if you met any problem.

### Install Hugo

I'm using MacOS and the installation is quite simple with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```Shell
brew install hugo
```

To check your installation:

```Shell
hugo version
```

the hugo version should show up if the installation is successful.

### Create your site

```Shell
hugo new site your-site-name
```

replace `your-site-name` with the name of your site. You can name it anything you want. The command above will create a folder named `your-site-name` in your current working directory. For example, if the current working directory is `/Users/huigong/projects`, your site will be located in `/Users/huigong/your-site-name`. If you are not sure about your working directory, just type `pwd` in your terminal:

```Shell
$ pwd
/Users/huigong/projects
```

and the output shows your working directory.

### Choose a theme

```Shell
cd your-site-name
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/spf13/hyde.git
```

There're around 300 themes for Hugo. I chose [hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde) for my blog. You can find a theme that fits you best [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/). If none of them is the perfect theme for you, you may consider create your own theme in the future and contribute to the Hugo community :)

Don't forget to configure the theme in `config.toml`. Simply add a line `theme = "hyde"` in the file. Replace `hyde` to the name of your own theme if you picked another theme.

### Build your site and push to GitHub

Creating content in Hugo is simple:

```Shell
hugo new posts/hello-world.md
```

this will create a new Markdown file named `Hello world` in the content/posts directory. Open the file with your favorite editor (shout out for VS Code) and change the `draft: true` to `draft: false`

### Create a blog source repository in GitHub

### Push source code to GitHub

### Automate the deploy using GitHub Action
