You want to build a personal blog but don't want to spend too much time building everything from scratch? Me too! After some research I get to know there're several static site generator out there and the most used generators are: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). All of them can work perfectly with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I chose Hugo as my site generator and it worked perfectly.

## What is Hugo

Hugo is a static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## Why Hugo

It's blazing fast! Hugo's official website states it is "the worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites" and after using it I've nothing to complain about the speed.

## Step by step

### Set up GitHub Pages

### Install Hugo

### Create your site

### Choose a theme

### Build your site and push to GitHub

### Create a blog source repository in GitHub

### Push source code to GitHub

### Automate the deploy using GitHub Action
